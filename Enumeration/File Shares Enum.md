- **Find-DomainShare 窶天erbose -ExcludeStandard -ExcludeIPC -ExcludePrint**: This command finds shares excluding standard, IPC, and print shares, which could potentially reveal non-standard or hidden shares.
- **Invoke-FileFinder 窶天erbose**: --> it tries to find sensitive files and computers in the domain. if we have read or write priviledges on share invoke-filefinder tries to look into interesting files into thous shares which contains inresting files like password or username etc...
- **Get-DomainFileServer -Verbose**: it looks for high value target ( lof of user autheticated too) for example domain controller is high value target or file server -- there are highg chances of numer of users to authenticated to file serverr same like go for exchange servers or shared paint servers. thus servers are consider as a high value targets in domain.
